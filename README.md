This Max4Live plug-in is a digital audio effect designed to be a hands-free improvisation tool. Clouds of looping audio grains are created from an incoming sound source. Grains are sampled and destroyed at periodic intervals as they wash in and out of focus.

The effect is a rebuild of a max patch used in my 2017 performance piece "EXECUTE PLAN B" for flugelhorn and 8 channel surround. [You can listen to a stereo excerpt on SoundCloud.](https://soundcloud.com/simon-matthews-howard/execute-plan-b-performance-excerpt)

Thanks to [Martin Parker](https://github.com/tinpark) for the handy grain window patch used in this plugin.

## How to Use

1. Ensure that you have MAX4LIVE setup in Ableton
2. Drag and drop .amxd file into effect chain of an audio track in Ableton Live.
3. Set some parameters in the UI and use to DRY/WET controls to mix the effect with incoming signal
4. Have fun!

## Known Bugs

* Using multiple instances of this effect in one Ableton Live project will do stange things
