Max4Live Plug-In

Aftersperse lies somewhere in-between a delay, a time stretcher, and a granular synthesiser. Clouds of looping audio grains are created from an incoming sound source. Grains are sampled and destroyed at periodic intervals as they wash in and out of focus.

The plug-in was designed as a hands-free improvisation tool, providing material for a performer to respond to based on what was previously played

The effect is a rebuild of a max patch used in my 2017 performance piece "EXECUTE PLAN B" for flugelhorn and 8 channel surround. You can listen to a stereo excerpt on SoundCloud.

v0.1 is the basic concept realised with minimal features, ready to plug straight into your Ableton workflow.

Thanks to Martin Parker for the fantastically handy grain window patch used in this plugin.
